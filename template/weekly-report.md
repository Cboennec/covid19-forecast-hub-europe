### 16 March 2021

We collect, visualise, and combine weekly forecasts of Covid-19 cases
and deaths across Europe.

On 15 March 2021, we collected forecasts from 20 teams. Each team
contributed a short-term forecast of new Covid-19 deaths or cases, for
at least one of 32 countries. We combined the forecasts using a mean
average. See the [visualisation]() or the [raw data]() for detailed
forecasts for Europe and each country.

#### Short term situation

Over the next week, forecasters largely expect cases and deaths from
Covid-19 to increase, with this trend forecast in 16 of 32 countries
across Europe. Reports of cases and deaths per 100,000 population are
expected to increase in 16 and 3 countries, respectively.

#### Trends over time

##### Deaths from Covid-19

Czechia, Hungary, and Slovakia are likely to see the highest increases
in deaths.

In Czechia, deaths are expected to increase to approximately 10 (10-20)
